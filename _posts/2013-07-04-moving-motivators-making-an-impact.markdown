As any powerful tool they can be used very wrong. I did it many times myself. At the same time being applied at the right moment they may have a massive effect. Here's a story.

<div>
<p>Several months ago my fiancee got an invitation to a new job. That day at the time I met here she was everything but calm. It was obvious she had been trying to make a choice for many hours and became very anxious she didn't advance in her decision at all. And then I suggested to play <a title="Moving Motivators" href="http://www.noop.nl/2011/09/moving-motivators-free-exercise.html" target="_blank">Moving Motivators</a> to her. She's usually quite skeptic to such things nevertheless she agreed as she really wanted to choose before going to bed. After about an hour (during which she was talking and talking and talking) the game was finished and the decision was made. Maria was so exited she took a picture of cards on a table. I was absolutely sure she would proudly show it to her friends at work :).</p>
<p>But it's not the end.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago we went for a walk discussing her job. She told me, <em>"I chatted with Katja about you"</em>. <em>"Oh dear!"</em>, was my first thought. <em>"So what did you talk about?"</em>. <em>"Well, about many things. I also related her how we had played that card game. She was very intrigued and wanted to try. Can I borrow it?"</em>. Shocked is a soft word for how I felt that moment. One hour game several months ago and Maria keeps on talking about it!</p>
<p>I'm far from being a good player. I recognize it clearly now. And from this moment on <strong>I'm not just playing games, I'm making an impact</strong>.</p>
