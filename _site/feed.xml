          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://futurice.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Futurice&lt;/a&gt; and me have the longest “relationships” among the organisations in my tour. It sparkled my interest in more detailed investigation of fantastic companies. Futurice also became the first organisation which I studied carefully and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/research/futurice.html&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt;. As you see it was no surprise at all I was excited when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ykarikos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yrjö&lt;/a&gt; invited me to take part in &lt;em&gt;FutuFriday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Reaktor</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reaktor.fi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reaktor&lt;/a&gt; got into my sight when I was preparing for two weeks in Helsinki. I went through my notes and found the only brief &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/finnish-reaktor-innovations-was-selected-as-the-best-workplace-in-europe-152597585.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the company. It described that Reaktor won Best Place to Work in Europe award two times. Nevertheless, I got hooked. My interest grew considerably after I had visited their website and watched the video below. Reaktor’s own band recorded it and they use it “to make recruiting the summer help a whole lot more fun”.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anttiki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evilbubu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juha&lt;/a&gt; last summer on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ale2014.alenetwork.eu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALE&lt;/a&gt;. We should meet in Vantaa airport right before our flight. I had already spent several hours in the airport to that moment and fell asleep on a bench near the gate. Luckily I woke just in time to run into the airplane but I missed the meeting. It was the first (and I hope the last) time I missed the opportunity to drink beer with guys from Flowa.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Small things</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the week was frantic. I was running like a squirrel in a wheel trying to complete a mountain of tiny mechanical tasks related to my departure. Anxiety didn’t leave me. I was fearing the tour would be a disaster. Even the meeting with friends didn’t help a lot. Yesterday I went to visit my family who just came back from Croatia where they had stayed for a week. They handed me a book and the moment I took it my mood changed considerably… &lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you watched &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;One fine day&quot; href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117247/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One fine day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? It’s a kind funny story about two single parents who were late to bring their children to a boat trip and had to spend a whole crazy business day together. Of course falling in love at the end. I like this simple movie because it conveys very important thought: &lt;strong&gt;We should stop constantly trying to fix things. We should let them be as they are and enjoy the moment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;strong&gt;test runs&lt;/strong&gt; in all spheres of our life. Extreme sport athletes ride a track several times before an event to know it better. Social networks first open new features to a small set of users to check their reaction. Companies have trial periods to prove a new hire is a good fit for the rest of a team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hard and funny</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;No matter how many dreams there are it’s easy to have them. Living even a tiny one is hard. Looking back over my shoulder I see how often I preferred an easy choice over a hard one. It didn’t make me happy. It didn’t make my life more fun, interesting and intriguing. Only simpler. About a week ago I gladly realized this time was over and I need to thank Happy Melly for that. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What is the colour of your life?</title>
        
        
          <img src="http://changegeek.ru/images/rainbow.png"/>
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;I experimented with multiple approaches to analyse my work. Only one of them stuck to me and have been helping me every day since then. Its major advantage is simplicity: I need to spend &lt;strong&gt;only 15 seconds per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of rush development we are glad to present a mobile-friendly version of Kudobox. It is easy to use, looks nice and, most important, gives you power to appreciate anyone from anywhere!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Appreciation Day</title>
        
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Thursday I was approached by two guys at local startup gathering to discuss what a value of &lt;a title=&quot;Kudo Box&quot; href=&quot;http://www.management30.com/workout/kudo-box/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kudobox&lt;/a&gt; as a practice and a value of &lt;a title=&quot;Kudobox&quot; href=&quot;http://kudobox.co&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online Kudobox&lt;/a&gt; particularly is. There were a lot to say but one of the best stories I could tell them appeared the next day. And it was &lt;a title=&quot;ACA IT Solutions&quot; href=&quot;http://www.aca-it.be/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ACA IT-Solutions&lt;/a&gt; which related it…&lt;/p&gt;
