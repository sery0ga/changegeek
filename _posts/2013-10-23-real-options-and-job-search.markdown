As many of you I had used <a title="Real Options Underlie Agile Principles" href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/real-options-enhance-agility" target="_blank">Real Options</a> before I got to know how they were called a few years ago. However, the Era of Real Options in my life began when I started to translate <a title="Commitment" href="http://commitment-thebook.com" target="_blank">"Commitment"</a> by <a title="Chris Matts" href="https://twitter.com/PapaChrisMatts" target="_blank">Chris Matts</a> and <a title="Olav Maassen" href="https://twitter.com/OlavMaassen" target="_blank">Olav Maassen</a>. Many options have been appearing daily since when, in various spheres. So it was just a matter of time for me to come up with an interesting option in my job searching journey.

<h2>Interviews</h2>
<p>I don't like job interviews. During a very short period of time an interviewer needs to understand if:</p>
<ul class="short">
<li>a person has enough skills;</li>
<li>she is a good cultural fit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Stakes are high. <strong>A right employee could drastically improve your competitiveness but you'd just waste precious time and efforts on a wrong one.</strong> It's particularly relevant for small business. I interviewed many developers myself and I would prefer to have better success/failure ratio.</p>
<p>On the other hand a person who is interviewed, confronts an enormous challenge if a company is good enough for him to spend several years of his life there. The life is short and wasting even a year in a company which doesn't suit you is very expensive.</p>
<p>These are main reasons why a process of job searching is so slow. <strong>Companies and candidates are afraid of making a wrong choice.</strong> That's why probation period is used in many organizations.</p>
<h2>Probation</h2>
<p>Probation is much better than interview. A probation resolves the issues described above (most of the time). Unfortunately, it also has some minuses:</p>
<ol>
<li>a probation usually takes place after an interview so a very good candidate could be filtered before she could show her strong sides and value to an organization;</li>
<li>if you live in a different country and do not have a work permit (my case!), it is rarely an option. Relocation costs are high and a company should prove it's not possible to find an alternative on a local market.</li>
</ol>
<p>Putting aside the first minus, let's try to handle the second one.</p>

## Real Options to the Rescue

So my suggestion is:

<ul class="dash">
<li>I arrive and work for free at your company, say, for two weeks. Two weeks should be enough to get into the process and make some impact.</li>
<li>I pay flight and living expenses by myself;</li>
<li>If you say "No, Sergey, you're not good enough for us" after two weeks, I'll get back home with an excellent experience in my pocket and a couple of new friends. All money you'll lose in this case is time you'll spend on me and water from a cooler.</li>
<li>If you decide to give me a role in your team after two weeks, you'll pay me back my costs (hotel, flight) and two weeks of my employment based on my salary as soon as I'll arrive after getting a work visa.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>You get:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>An opportunity to take much more weighted decision with opinions from many employees;</li>
<li>Much better understanding what skills and expertise I have and how they can be used more effectively and efficiently;</li>
<li>In case you say "Go!", my work visa will be ready in two-three months. Knowing my skills and expertise it will be more easy for you to choose a project for me. We can even discuss a remote work.</li>
<li>Access to my expertise and skills for free during two weeks in case you say "No!" <em>And</em> t<em>hey're quite expensive here, in Russia</em> :).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I get:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Better chances to get hired by your company;</li>
<li>Clear understanding if your organization and I suit each other;</li>
<li>2 weeks in a beautiful city and new friends <em>(I suppose your company is in a beautiful city. I'm used to such cities living in Saint-Petersburg).</em></li>
</ol>

And remember: as any other real option this option expires soon because I have a limited time and finance capacity to travel around Europe and work for free :).</p>
