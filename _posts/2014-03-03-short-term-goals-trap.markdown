About three weeks ago one of the team members asked me <em>"Do we have short-term goals?</em><em> How will we understand for example in a month if we're good or not?</em>".<em> </em>It took me a moment to realize that I had ones but I hadn't forgotten them with the team. So I promised to write them down and share.

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">A set of short-term goals I created included both qualitative and absolute quantitative goals. Some examples are:</span></p>
<ul class="dash">
<li>minimum 5 happy users who create kudos 3-4 times per week;</li>
<li>a number of visits per week grows steadily;</li>
<li>a number of new kudos per week grows steadily.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another team member pinged me in a couple of days after I had shared those goals:</p>
<p><em>"Hey, are we going to use SEO? I know a great guy who can help us with it."</em></p>
<p><strong>"</strong><strong>What? Why the hell do we need SEO?"</strong></p>
<p>After a small chat we decided to postpone the discussion till the next day when we had a planned team Skype talk. During that team talk he finally said:</p>
<p><em>"OK, explain me then how are we going to achieve those goals?"</em></p>
<p>Gotcha! The moment of truth! <strong>As soon as I described the short-term goals some team members forgot about a long-term value and started to think how to get fast results.</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Short-term goals (especially formulated in absolute values) are easy to be gamed. If you start to tie your product's success or team rewards to them, you're doomed.</p></blockquote>
<p>For me short-term goals are something <strong>nice to achieve</strong> and <strong>a good reason to retrospect</strong>. And nothing more. I'm glad we got a chance to talk about the importance of short-term goals so early. It means we didn't lose any very valuable time or money :).</p>
<p>This is my #kudo to Sanja for opening the discussion. <strong>Do not hesitate to a</strong><strong>ppreciate your colleagues, <a title="Kudobox" href="http://kudobox.co" target="_blank">send a kudo</a>!</strong></p>
