I'm a strange guy. For a couple of years I had thought a phrase <em>"DevOps is a mindset"</em> was weird.

<h1>A story</h1>
<p>I worked for many years for a company whose culture of dominance and secrecy made a huge impact on me - I almost didn't interact with people outside the company on professional topics during several years. At the same time my constant hunger to <img class="alignright" title="DevOps" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8539/8634021085_96a6619de6_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="235" />knowledge and technical excellence (and a supportive culture of mastery) kept pushing me forward so I know <strong>a lot</strong> about web services and related stuff.</p>
<p>One of the finest moment in my professional career was a decision of the business owners to put me on a project with our director of IT. We started the project from scratch and led it together. I was assigned because of my development expertise and good domain knowledge. He... well, he was nine years older and much more experienced in managing projects.</p>
<p>The system we developed should be scalable, highly available and work under high load. I don't remember when we discussed the first design issue together but during next years he had taught me how to configure Linux systems, balance traffic, efficiently store large amount of data and make a backup easily. I liked it very much and made my hands "dirty" regularly. Thanks to him and our collaboration I learnt to look at technical issues in more <strong>systemic</strong> <strong>way</strong> and tried to find a solution in many areas not only by improving code or choosing another database.</p>
<p>When I heard about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">DevOps</a> few years ago I felt stupid. I felt stupid because I didn't understand what it was all about. They talked about something <strong>very natural</strong> to me and I couldn't realize why they discussed it at all.</p>
<h1>Aha moment</h1>
<p>Last week I was invited by that company to audit an integration project. It should help two internal systems to share common data so I interviewed one team leader on what goals they wanted to achieve with it. The most important (and very questionable) decision was switching from <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> to <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">mongoDB</a> as it required a huge amount of refactoring in both systems. I kept asking <em>"Why do you need it?"</em> until he said <em>"Well, I'll be glad to use PostgreSQL if you explain to me how we can deal with our large<em> </em>amount of <em><em>expecting</em></em> data."</em></p>
<p>After five minutes I found myself two floors higher, talking to an old friend of mine - the director of IT. We found at least two solutions to all issues which didn't need so much coding in less than a half an hour. <em>"Have you talked to them about your ideas?",</em> I asked. <em>"I don't see any reason. They come to me. They ask for advice. They implement a solution which is wrong from my point of view and have problems. I don't want to waste my time anymore."</em></p>
<p>It was a moment when I realized that <strong>DevOps is a mindset</strong>. But then...</p>
<h1>Limits of DevOps Mindset</h1>
<p>Separating development, quality assurance and operations is a bad idea. It's a <strong>reductionist </strong>approach and any system thinker tells you it doesn't work for complex systems. DevOps is a big step forward as it is much more <strong>holistic</strong> <strong>view</strong> on a process of software development.</p>
<p>At the same time DevOps is about <em>doing things right.</em> It doesn't help if your developers in collaboration with IT engineers regularly deploy a very stable <strong>crap</strong> which nobody needs. Don't get me wrong! I <strong>love</strong> DevOps as approach. <em>Using it as mindset is discordant to me.</em></p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>I'm a strange guy. I keep thinking a phrase <em>"DevOps is a mindset"</em> is weird.</p>
