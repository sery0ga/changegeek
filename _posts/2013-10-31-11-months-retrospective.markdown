<a title="John Maxwell" href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/81497-change-is-inevitable-growth-is-optional" target="_blank">Change is inevitable</a>. Change is a way to adapt to an environment, to survive and thrive. Nobody can resist change, even <a title="Sheldon Cooper" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Cooper" target="_blank">Sheldon Cooper</a>. Temptation to resist change is huge because change often moves us out of our comfort zones and brings fear. The purpose of this blog is to learn to change faster, to widen my comfort zone and to become more resilient to change.

<p>However, a change is not always a progress. I regularly review if the directions I go are the ones I want to go. I celebrate new knowledge received from small wins and failures every week or two. It helps me to convert my changes to my progress. At the same time I like to analyze longer periods - at least six months. Such 10,000 feet views remove details and leave only major paths and achievements.</p>
<p>11 months ago I left my first company, the place where I worked for more than 6 years. I left because I wanted to run more experiments. I left because I wanted to make bigger positive impact on people lives. I left because I wanted to be happier. And this post is my retrospective notes.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><strong>I love working. </strong>It's my main take-away from two months (December and January) I did nothing besides sleeping, reading and coding.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing is not for me and <a title="JetBrains" href="http://jetbrains.com" target="_blank">JetBrains</a> is a great company. </strong>I worked for five months there. Almost everything was very well except I did a job I didn't like :). And I didn't do it well. And I was fired. And I danced then because I was happy about that decision.</li>
<li><strong>I love</strong> <strong>coding. </strong>My friend and I spent six months (mostly evenings) developing absolutely crazy project - an alternative interpreter for PHP on <a title="PyPy" href="http://pypy.org" target="_blank">PyPy</a>. We stopped to implement it because it started to take too much time.</li>
<li><strong>I know nothing</strong>. I was lucky to join <a title="Happy Melly Team" href="http://www.happymelly.com/people/" target="_blank">Happy Melly team</a> at April. It was the first time in my life I was working with people who knew much more than me about areas of my interest. I was a student again. I am still a student. It is fun!</li>
<li><strong>Translators are my heroes. Most of them. </strong>I translated <a title="Commitment" href="http://commitment-thebook.com" target="_blank">a book about managing project risks</a>. Comic book. It was so hard I can't even imagine how people translate "A Study in Scarlet" not saying about "War and Peace".</li>
<li>It is easy to organize local community meetings. <strong>Just do it. </strong>I restarted local agile community this year. I used my experience from <a title="Happy Melly" href="http://happymelly.com" target="_blank">Happy Melly</a> and modified my approach: <a title="AgilePiter" href="http://agilepiter.ru" target="_blank">a community's blog</a>, <a title="Community" href="https://plus.google.com/communities/112264824472767454602" target="_blank">a group in G+</a>, regular posts and meetings, collaboration with other communities. In two weeks we'll have a mini-conference with remote participants from Moldova. I did nothing. Everything (topic, location, format, talks) was suggested by the community members.</li>
<li><strong>Any idea has its supporters. All you need is to find them.</strong> I've been dreaming for a couple of years about organizing <a title="Coding Dojo" href="http://codingdojo.org" target="_blank">coding dojos</a>. Tomorrow I'll run a first one in JetBrains. If it goes well, after two-three internal runs we'll open them for participants from any company in Saint-Petersburg.</li>
<li>I'm looking for <a title="Jon in Europe" href="http://www.changegeek.ru/blog/2013/10/23/real-options-and-job-search/" target="_blank">a job in Europe</a>. First two months I sent requests to many companies. I spent a lot of time, had very low ratio and no job suggestions. Next two months I filtered vacancies more carefully based on previous experience. I spent much less time, had higher ratio and no job suggestions. Now I do not send my resume, only if a vacancy is a perfect suit (rare case!). I invest in my network. <strong>People first.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Blogging is difficult.</strong> The first challenge is to share my thoughts and be ready to get a negative feedback. I'm in debt to <a title="Yves Hanoulle" href="http://www.hanoulle.be/" target="_blank">Yves Hanoulle</a> for his positive feedback on my first post which motivated me to keep writing. The second challenge is to formulate my ideas in foreign language which I doesn't know well enough. It takes so much time. But more I write, more easier it is.  The third challenge is to get no feedback at all. But more I write, more interactions I have after each post. So I keep writing.</li>
<li>I run multiple experiments in parallel and I get small results fast. I changed a design of <a title="Change Geek" href="http://changegeek.ru" target="_blank">my website</a>. I launched a first version of my new service. I wrote <a title="Lost In Translation" href="http://www.changegeek.ru/ru/2013/10/23/lost-in-translation/" target="_blank">a post in Russian</a>. I keep <a title="Interviews" href="http://agilepiter.ru/index.php/category/interview/" target="_blank">interviewing</a> local agile activists. I keep organizing local community meetings. I have done it all this month. <strong>Small wins at steady pace</strong> is my motto.</li>
<li><strong>I am happy. I love what I do now.</strong> I'm expecting more thrilling changes in the nearest future. I'm going to try new approach to learning. I'm going to spend two weeks at <a title="Lunatech" href="http://lunatech.com/" target="_blank">Lunatech</a> at the end of November sharing experience and having fun. I'm going to organize a fascinating meetup with HR managers about culture in companies.</li>
</ol>
<p>My 30th anniversary is in a few days. It's time to prepare for it so I'm done for now.</p>
