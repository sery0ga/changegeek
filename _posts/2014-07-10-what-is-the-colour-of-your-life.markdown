I experimented with multiple approaches to analyse my work. Only one of them stuck to me and have been helping me every day since then. Its major advantage is simplicity: I need to spend <strong>only 15 seconds per day</strong>.

<p>Yeap, by spending <strong>only</strong> <strong>15 seconds per day</strong> you could considerably improve your work. Interested? Keep reading!</p>

## Research

I'm going to give a talk "Unexpected Journey or How To Quit Your Job" in August at <a title="Agile Lean Europe" href="ale2014.alenetwork.eu" target="_blank">Agile Lean Europe</a>. When I got an approval from the organizers, I thought, <em>Can I give to people any tool they may use immediately after the conference?</em> I loved one tool I'd been using for several months up to that moment. I wanted to test if the tool might be useful for others. I asked my colleagues and friends to use this approach and provide me a feedback.

Everything you find below is based on my own experience and the feedback from my colleagues and friends.

## Description

There are two stages of the usage of the tool.

### Initiation stage

**Task 0:** I hope you have at least one professional middle-/long-term goal. Write it down or draw it if you haven't done it yet. The tool will work without a goal, but if you have one, you will create very useful connections with your everyday results and a goal. The impact will be bigger.

**Task 1:** think and define what it means for you &mdash; **being satisfied with your work**. Recall when your work brought you the highest satisfaction. What sides of your work make you happy? Write it down, no more than 3-5 points.

**Task 2:** find a calendar or buy one :).

### Main stage

Every day you need to ask yourself just one question:<b> "Am I at least 75% satisfied with my past working day?"</b>. If yes, paint the date over with a green colour. If no, a red one.

That's all the magic!
<h2>It works</h2>
<p>Unfortunately only a small percent of creative workers asks themselves regularly "How was my working day?" Several my colleagues pointed out that the requirement to answer the question motivates them <strong>to plan their day better to make it green at the end</strong>. Several others said this simple everyday analysis helped them <strong>to dissolve some issues they hadn't found time to deal with before.</strong></p>
<p>Looking at longer period (a month or more), the tool reveals how your working life is going. <a title="The Optimist Bias" href="http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2074067-2,00.html" target="_blank">Our brains is optimised for imagining the future, not reproducing the past</a>. As a result we leave out many details recalling what happened a week ago. Besides this, <a title="Thinking Fast And Slow" href="http://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555" target="_blank">our brains rank higher</a> the events which took place a couple of days ago than two weeks old events. One good or bad day at the end of the month makes a bigger impact on the final month's score that the first two weeks.</p>
<p>The tool helps to visualise your working life and makes your retrospective more objective. Some of my colleagues found out <strong>their jobs were not that bad as they thought</strong> only after two weeks of playing with the tool.</p>

## There is no silver bullet

Of course, the tool won't be useful for everyone. Some of you will find it valuable after the first week, some of you - only after the first month, and for some of you it will be useless. Here is what my colleagues and friends think about it after two week of the research:

<div class="blockquote">
    <div class="source">Anonymous Author</div>
    <div class="text">I started to plan my day more seriously. When you have such explicit metric as "the satisfaction of the past day" it's easier to overcome your laziness. I also began to feel time better"</div>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
    <div class="source">Simon Lyashenko</div>
    <div class="text">It disciplines me in some way as it plays a role of daily meeting. It's also useful that the upper limit is not 100%. You have some level of freedom which allows you to "feel comfortable" even if you couldn't do everything you planned</div>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
    <div class="source">Denis Misharin</div>
    <div class="text">There is no value for me right now :). But at least it makes me look back at the past day in the beginning of the next one. And not to run further immediately :)</div>
</div>
<div class="blockquote">
    <div class="source"><a title="Lisette Sutherland" href="http://www.happymelly.com/members/#/2" target="_blank">Lisette Sutherland</a></div>
    <div class="text">It would be nice to see all the scores at once, to get an idea of how happy I am at work overall - and over time.</div>
</div>

## Your next step

You may be a lone warrior and start using this approach all by yourself. Or...  you may<strong> join our group </strong>and get a daily email or a daily message in Facebook from me with the only question "Are you at least 75% satisfied with your past working day?". <strong>It helps you to form a good habit faster and motivates you much more than a boring automatic reminder. </strong>

<p><strong><a href="mailto:skotlov@gmail.com" target="_blank">Send me</a> a message, join the group and colour your life in green!</strong></p>
