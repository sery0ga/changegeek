          <p><em>This is the second post of three-part series. Read about <a title="What are our goals?" href="http://www.changegeek.ru/2013/07/1-hour-drive-to-product-development-1-of-3/">goals and costs</a> in the first part</em><em>.</em></p>

<p>While driving I was thinking about a correlation between customer satisfaction and operational costs. I came up with the points that focus on customer satisfaction from the very beginning:</p>
<ul class="dash">
<li><strong>may</strong> lead to longer time-to-market of the first release and higher initial costs. So we loose in short term.</li>
<li><strong>always</strong> leads to lower operational costs and steeper product dynamic. So we win in long term.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Operational costs and customer satisfaction</h2>
<p>It's not a part of F1 track on the image below. Unfortunately a piece of our route to Viborg is depicted here.<strong></strong></p>
<p><a href="/images/meandering_road.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-88" title="Meandering Road" src="/images/meandering_road.png" alt="A Piece of A Road To Viborg" width="642" height="440" /></a></p>
<p>This small section of the road (less tha<strong></strong>n 6 km) contains at least 13 turns, 2 railways crossroads and goes through 2 tiny villages. And no, this area is not mountainous at all! Then <strong>why was this section done that way? </strong>The only answer I find appropriate is <strong>costs in short term </strong>(or building costs):</p>
<ul class="dash">
<li>cheaper and faster to build a road around a tiny hill than to dig into it.</li>
<li>cheaper and faster to let a road go near villages than to make additional side roads to these villages.</li>
</ul>
<p>But is it cheaper? In <strong>long term case </strong>both operational and customer costs come to stage:</p>
<ul class="dash">
<li>time wasted by each driver on turns and crossroads;</li>
<li>money spent to repair the road which is longer than needed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is it faster? Definitely it is. The builders got much <strong>shorter time to market </strong>and much <strong>lower driver satisfaction</strong> as drivers have to pay for longer and more dangerous route, villagers have to live in noisier and more polluted environment.</p>
<p><em>If only customer satisfaction in long term was taken into account the road would have very different shape.</em></p>
<p>"These is no impact on software development," one could say. "Code is easily refactored comparing to road. I don't need to plan far ahead and invest money in something which is not important now and can increase our time to market. I can improve it later, in iterative way. After all we're agile now." I agree with such saying if the talk is about <strong>functionality</strong> and completely disagree if the one assumes <strong>quality</strong>.</p>
<p>I had a similar talk several days ago when I met with a perspective client making popular social games. There were three project managers at the meeting who lead projects of different sizes and durations. Two older and larger projects experienced problems with bugs popping up regularly and slowing a development of new functionality. The manager of the third younger project was much more optimistic.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>PM: </strong>"We don't have so large customer base and don't care about bugs right now. We produce new features and it's our main direction. Most bugs are stored into a bugtracker."<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>"I assume the other projects did the same when they were of your size. And they have difficulties now. What are you going to do?"<br />
<strong>PM:</strong> "We'll start to spend more time on bug fixing."<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>"In this case your dynamics of producing new features will become flatter."<br />
<strong>PM:</strong> "I'll hire more developers then."<br />
<strong>Me: </strong>"New developers will produce more code which also contains bugs, right? I don't see how new people will help you."<br />
<strong>PM:</strong> "Hmm.. then we'll do the same changes the other two projects will do to deal with their current issues."</p></blockquote>
<p>Good idea. The only issue -  two other project managers didn't know how to resolve these issues the time we talked!</p>
<p>Customer satisfaction depends on many variables including quality, features and dynamic of features' appearing. As most customers (<a title="Early and Late Majority" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_majority">early and late majority</a>) I'm much more freaked out by bugs than a lack of new thrilling functionality. Even more: my annoyance increases when new features are deployed and important bugs aren't fixed. I stopped using Ubuntu because of bugs reappearing after updates.</p>
<p>Investments into quality (customer satisfaction in long term) from the very beginning let you save a lot of money in the future and gives you steeper growth curve because with bad quality:</p>
<ul class="dash">
<li>developers' engagement decreases;</li>
<li>number of conflicts inside a team and pressure start growing;</li>
<li>developers have to switch from new features to firing bugs constantly. I don't need to say why <a title="Context Switching" href="http://www.jrothman.com/2005/01/convincing-management-that-context-switching-is-a-bad-idea/">context switching is a bad idea</a>.</li>
<li>support guys spend more time for issues research and dealing with customers;</li>
<li>you need to spend more money on marketing because bugs decrease customer satisfaction and they don't advertise your product for free.</li>
<li>by fixing more firing bugs a team produces less new features and users don't like it;</li>
<li>(specifically for social products) lower customer satisfaction decrease customer satisfaction: more people dissatisfied with a product, less they use it; less people use it, more people dissatisfied with it. It's a reinforcement loop.</li>
</ul>
<p>Another pro point is that it's cheaper to develop high quality product from the first day than try to increase quality later, after months of development.</p>
<p>What about you? Do you think about customer satisfaction in short term, long term or both?</p>
