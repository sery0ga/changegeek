I have many dreams. There are small nice-to-have-but-can-live-without dreams like having a good voice. There are huge crazy-flavoured dreams like founding high-tech floating city somewhere in the Caribbean. Not surprisingly most of my dreams are between these two extremes. It would be a daunting task to list even a fraction of them. I leave it for my memoirs and to unfortunate readers who will buy them.

<p>No matter how many dreams there are it’s easy to have them. Living even a tiny one is hard. Looking back over my shoulder I see how often I preferred an easy choice over a hard one. It didn’t make me happy. It didn’t make my life more fun, interesting and intriguing. Only simpler. About a week ago I gladly realized this time was over and I need to thank <a title="Happy Melly" href="http://happymelly.com" target="_blank">Happy Melly</a> for that.</p>
<p>Joining Happy Melly was one of the best decisions I ever made. Working daily with people like <a title="Jurgen Appelo" href="http://www.happymelly.com/people/#/jurgen.appelo" target="_blank">Jurgen</a>, <a title="Lisette Sutherland" href="http://www.happymelly.com/people/#/lisette.sutherland" target="_blank">Lisette</a> or <a title="Vasco Duarte" href="http://www.happymelly.com/people/#/vasco.duarte" target="_blank">Vasco</a> — people who are more clever, more experienced and more determined in living their dreams — pushed and keep pushing me forward. I started with replacing my rather calm, well-paid office job to unpredictable and sometimes unnerving freelancer path because I felt the former was making me miserable. Then I ended 5 years long relationships with my girlfriend because true love had disappeared. I changed numerous smaller things in my life last year and now it’s time for the next bigger step.</p>
<p>I always dream about traveling around the world moving from one country to another. However traveling on its own has never fascinated me. Being an introvert it’s difficult for me to find a reason to connect with people. I also become bored fast if I do sightseeing all day long. I needed a purpose and I found it with Happy Melly.</p>
<p>On April 1 I’m going on Happy Melly Networking Tour. My goal is to meet people and visit organisations which are in Happy Melly network or support the idea of helping others to be happy at work. I want to understand these people and organisations better and I’d be glad to share my findings with you.</p>
<p><i>I’m still planning my route and I kindly ask you for your help. If you know people and organisations I must meet or visit, I’ll be glad to hear from you.</i></p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - it’s frightfully scary. At the same time I’ve never had so much fun before. There’s no road back. <strong>Hard and funny life is way better than easy and insipid one!</strong></p>
