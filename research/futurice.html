    <div class="reference-block">
      <blockquote class="highlight">
        <ul class="dash">
          <li><b>Trust.</b> Trust is the key factor in our culture as it ties our values

      <p>I was lucky to take part in FutuFriday. It’s a day reserved for learning, communication and exchange of ideas. That time their CEO <a href="http://futurice.com/people/tuomas-syrjanen" target="_blank">Tuomas Syrjänen</a> gave a talk. He shared what he had observed on their internal communication channels, how it reflected his understanding of company values and what he learned from it. He openly talked how his behaviour hadn’t been aligned with their values and how he was going to change it.</p>
      <p>During that sincere and informal speech one thought kept coming to my mind, <a href="http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/lead_by_example.html"
      target="_blank">Lead by example</a>. When a leader of an organisation communicates this way it motivates everyone to behave in a similar transparent manner. For Futurice words trust and transparency are not something they wrote down, put on a wall and forgot. The company actually lives these values.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2 id="roles">Roles and Structure</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Futurice has offices in Helsinki, Tampere, Berlin, London and Lausanne. The largest one is in Helsinki where the company was founded. Wide geographic coverage brings additional challenges. On one hand they want to share the same set of values and keep the identify of Futurice around all offices. On the other hand the offices outside Helsinki should be autonomous and fully functional. Current approach to structure the organisation helps them to deal with complexity. When the situation changes they will change the structure accordingly.</p>
      <p>There are several tribes and service teams at Futurice.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h4>Tribes</h4>
      <p><b>Tribe</b> is a group of roughly 30-50 Futupeople united by the only principle &mdash; they want to work together. The tribes are customer-oriented. All services provided by Futurice to its customers are provided by members of the tribes. Each tribe is responsible for its P&amp;L, employee engagement and professional improvement, customer satisfaction and so on. In short, each tribe operates as a small company and as autonomously as possible from other tribes.</p>
      <p>Tribes are location-based. There are three or four tribes in Helsinki office, and one tribe in each other city as they are not big enough yet.</p>
      <p>The process of tribes’ formation was self-organized and facilitated. People naturally selected tribes with fellows whom they worked on customer premises and knew better. During tribe formation one more task was solved. Each tribe serves a set of big clients and a number of small ones. Some of these clients, especially big ones, might be competitors and issues could arise if one group of people work for both of them. Futurice tried to create tribes the way that such clashes wouldn’t happen. </p>
      <p>Tribe has 3-4 chiefs that were selected by the tribe itself. The chiefs are responsible for helping members of the tribe to do a great job and keep the tribe successful and engaged. The chiefs practice lead and engage approach, not command and control. Their power is limited and Futupeople could vote by their feet &mdash; if they don't like the tribe they could leave it any day.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="reference-block">
      <blockquote>
          Tribe has 3-4 chiefs and the rest are tribe members. The tribe size is capped at 60 (with desired minimum being 30, but this may not be strictly adhered to). There is no externally expected structure within the tribe; any internal structure a tribe has is of their own devising.
      </blockquote>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Being part of a tribe doesn't mean a Futuperson doesn't work on projects with people from other tribes. Futurice lives by its values: <a href="#values">care about customer</a> goes first and removes any destructive competition. During my visit to Futurice, <a href="http://futurice.com/people/michael-samarin" target="_blank">Michail Samarin</a> mentioned that around 20% of tribe members moving from tribe to tribe on a regular basis.</p>
      <p>How does this movement look like? When a new gig appears the tribe chiefs seek to form a team. If all the people cannot be found from the tribe, the chiefs ask from other tribes. If a potential candidate is found they ask if he is interested in that gig. Tribe member could say “no” and tribe chiefs continue their search.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <h4>Project Teams</h4>
      <p>Futupersons rarely work at customer premises alone. In most cases they form project teams up to five-six people. Not only working in a team is more engaging but a customer gets more value. Project teams are self-sufficient units including developers, designers and UX experts. They deliver products of higher quality than lone wolves.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="content clear-fix">
      <h4>Service Teams</h4>
      <p >This setup covers many activities but not all. For example, there are <a href="#values">continuous improvement</a> or strategical planning on a company level. Some activities like initial screening of applicants can effectively use economy of scale without damaging their quality. </p>
      <p class="clear-fix">
        For these purposes Futurice has IT, Human Care, CTO Task Force and executive service teams. CTO Task Force is responsible for continuous support with competence development, meeting facilitation, personal coaching and mentoring. Other service teams are self-descriptive.

    <h2 id="information-flow">Information Flow</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Futurice believes that people won't be able to make good decision themselves without open and truthful communications. Most of the information is available to everyone in the company and they constantly improve its quality: not only people should know but they also should easily and clearly understand what the information conveys.</p>

      <ul class="dash">
        <li>All meetings are open. Everyone can join, listen and give an opinion;</li>
        <li>Notes from weekly executives' meetings are shared with the whole staff;</li>
        <li>Every month a report on financial performance is shared. It contains a lot of visual data to be easy to grasp;</li>
        <li>News about new hires, changes, projects and their statuses are delivered through <a href="http://www.flowdock.com" target="_blank">Flowdock</a>, emails and face to face meetings;</li>
        <li>For internal conferences and events a video conference connection is set up. Presentation are recorded and available
        on the intranet.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><i>FutuFriday</i> is held every first Friday of a month and it's common for all locations. FutuFriday takes half a day and is devoted to learning, sharing and creating a spirit of Futurice. It consists of several sections including PayDay Pizza, Ask the CEO Anything, Pecha Kucha presentations and others. At that day all Futupeople come to offices from clients' locations to share news, talk to colleagues and have fun.</p>
      <p>A video connection between offices is established to put all company together on FutuFriday, at least virtually. Futurice experiments with different tools to decrease the distance gap. When I took part in the event they used <a href="http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/" target="_blank">Google Hangouts</a>. And who knows what they will use in a half a year? May be there will be telepresence robots circling around the offices.</p>

      <ul class="dash clear-fix">

    <h2 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict Resolution</h2>
    <div class="content">
      <p>Futurice is built in a way that conflicts can be avoided at the outset or their emergence could be detected in early stages before actual clashes and unfavourable situations take place.</p>

      <ul class="dash">
        <li>common values and daily focus on everybody's well-being remove a lot of pressure;</li>
        <li>job satisfaction is regularly monitored through monthly surveys;</li>
        <li class="last"><a href="#weekly"><b>weekly smiles</b></a> help to relieve bad feelings and invite employees to discuss problems openly.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Thanks to <a href="#decision-making">3x2 model</a>, employees are obliged to do their best to find solution. Strong focus on autonomy and self-management significantly increase the chance a Futuperson resolves an issue himself.</p>

      <p>However, sometimes conflicts couldn't be resolved one on one. For this purpose a number of safety and support networks exists. A Futuperson can contact:</p>

      <ul class="clear-fix dash">
        <li>mentor, supervisor or coach;</li>
        <li>HR team which constantly communicate with employees to ensure it's very easy to approach HR in difficult situation;</li>

          <p>[...] I made the decision to get us communications
          training from a great local trainer. Even though I was convinced he
          would be good for us, it took me like 8 months to actually make the
          investment. We are talking about roughly 30000€ in direct expenses and
          lots of worktime. I was greatly helped by one of our sites doing a
          single session on their own, using the same pattern, which was very
          liked. This helped build internal interest and confidence to invest
          into the larger set. [...]</p>

      <p>Salary is based on your move along the career path which is discussed twice a year on <a href="#personal-development">checkpoints</a>.

At most companies next level means a next step in a common hierarchical ladder <i>Developer &rarr; Team Leader &rarr; Project Manager &rarr; Department Head</i>. Not at Futurice. Next level means a wider sphere of your responsibilities there. </p>
      <p>Obvious example is becoming a tribe leader. It’s just one path. Another path is become an advocate of some technology, running community of practice, writing blogposts and taking every chance to share interesting information about the topic you care about.</p>

      <p>Another important difference is that Futurice doesn't hire by needs. They have established network of trusted contractors which are ready to help in case of urgency. However, they won't hire anyone just to close a role.</p>

      <p id="interview">Futurice's recruitment steps:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><b>Get to know</b>. Run by HR and aimed to set up initial relationships with a candidate;</li>
        <li><b>Competence evaluation</b>. Run by HR and aimed to understand a level of qualification of a candidate. At this step the candidate decides which available team she wants to join;</li>
        <li><b>Team interview</b>. Run by team members (at least 3). A candidate gets homework which is discussed at the interview;</li>
        <li><b>Career level and career plan</b>. Run by supervisor and mentor and aimed to create an initial realistic career plan;</li>
        <li><b>Final</b>. Run by HR, aimed to close the recruitment process and at which all required paper work is done.</li>

      <h4>Onboarding</h4>
      <p>Futurice does it best to integrate a new employee into the life of the company. After 4 months of onboarding process a new employee should have a clear picture of the company, know many people, have a developed career plan and etc.</p>

      <p>It all starts on the first day when a new employee meets her team, mentor, supervisor, career coach, CEO and other random people.</p>

      <p>Onboarding includes many training like financial education, information security, intellectual property, quality. On first two months the employee also takes part in several group sessions aimed to provide basic information about different activities of the company, introduce new employees to each other and familiarize with various professional disciplines.</p>

      <p>During the onboarding process the employee has several interviews with HR, supervisor and mentor to check current state and discuss how the things are going.</p>

      <p>Last day of successful onboarding period is a team's celebration.</p>

      <h4>Turnover</h4>
      <p  class="clear-fix">
        Turnover in Futurice is very low. People like an autonomy, trust and openness. Moreover some people who left the company to experiment with other stuff, came back. There are “Back to Futurice” T-shirts specially designed for these cases.

      <h4>Career Path</h4>
      <p>Career Path is a long-term plan of professional development which every
      employee creates himself with support from a mentor, HR and manager. The process
      starts at <a href="#interview">the interview</a> and new changes come on
      a regular basis.</p>

      <p>Career Path helps to understand what direction employees want to grow
      and clarify resources the company could provide for faster movement along the path.</p>

      <h4>Mentoring</h4>
      <p>To proceed faster in personal growth, every Futuperson may have a mentor.
    Mentor plays multiple roles: a traditional mentor, coach, teacher, sparring
    partner (career and professional development) or work partner, as well as
    hugger, or a listener.</p>

      <p>Mentors are not simply more experienced colleagues &mdash;
    they take regular training to give people as much support as possible.</p>
      <br/>

      <p>In addition to a developed career path, Futupeople have weekly, monthly and semi-annually checkpoints. On semi-annually checkpoints a Futuperson together with the mentor and the supervisor creates a long-term vision and objectives. The mentor and the supervisor help to align the objectives with company's and team's strategy and vision, career patterns and so on. If needed they add short-term milestones to the list. Both long- and short-term vision and objectives are public thus enabling future support from other employees.</p>

      <h4 id="mad">MAD</h4>
      <p>Monthly checkpoints are called <b>MAD (Monthly Anonymous Developer)</b>
    and held on <a href="#information-flow">FutuFridays</a>. It's an one-hour
    meeting when each employee goes through the targets in a group of colleagues
    he considered best: team, project team or competence area team. Futulainens
    answer four questions:</p>

      <ul class="dash">
        <li>What are the goals?</li>
        <li>What did I try to make last month?</li>
        <li>How was it developed and what did I learn?</li>
        <li>What will I try to make this month and how I think can it be?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 id="weekly">Weekly :) (Weekly Smiles)</h4>
      <p>Weekly meetings got this name on purpose. Futupeople spend many
      hours at customers' locations and on Friday they meet each other, share their
      emotions, progress, failures and wins.</p>
      <p>These meetings help Futupeople to keep team spirit, get or give some help,
      talk about clients and grab latest news.</p>

      <br/>
      <p>Employees in Futurice run multiple internal conferences, trainings and
    workshops where everyone can learn or take part. <a href="#decision-making">3x2 model</a>
    motivates people to be proactive and organize trainings on topics not related
    to job at all. As mentioned in <a href="#investments">Investments</a>
    block, Futulainens can use their credit card for taking part in conferences or courses.</p>

      <p>Employees are compensated for taking part in open source projects. They share what they did in the open source channel in Flowdock and log in how many hours they spent. Sharing is a requirement and very smart one. Others in the company see that there’s someone interested in Haskell, for example. They could approach him any time to know more, to help with the development or to suggest a new project.</p>
