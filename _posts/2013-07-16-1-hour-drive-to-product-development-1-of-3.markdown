Roads in Russia is a byword. There are so few of them (comparing to many other countries) and most of them are so bad.

<blockquote><p>There are only two problems in Russia: fools and roads.</p></blockquote>
<p>a famous Russian saying reads. And this post about third problem -- <em>"fools who build these roads"</em>.</p>
<p>Several days ago we decided to visit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyborg">Vyborg</a>, a small town standing about 1-hour drive from the place we spent our vacation. The weather was sunny and warm, the mood was even better. The only downside was -- yes, you're right -- the road. Turning the wheel insanely fast to overtake numerous holes I found some fallacies made during building and maintenance of the road which are too common in a product development.</p>
<h3>What are our goals?</h3>
<p>On our way we run into this railway crossing</p>
<p><a href="http://changegeek.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP_000455.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-67" title="Railroad Crossing, Overview" src="http://changegeek.ru//wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WP_000455-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="468" /></a></p>
<p>From current perspective it looks pretty well: road marking, traffic signs, semaphore. Even more: the signs are new one and I'm pretty sure at least one of them was missed last year. What does it mean? It means this part of the road was repaired recently. Road workers came there, looked at it and said: <em>"This railway crossing is not safe. Not all required signs are present"</em>. They put new signs and left the place.They did their job. They thought so.</p>

<p>I crossed the rails at an extremely low speed because I was afraid of damaging my car. It's not possible to get out of it quite fast if you see a forthcoming train -- multiple holes prevent any effort effectively. When I successfully passed the dangerous zone, one story which had happened a couple of years ago came to my mind.</p>
<p>That time we had problems with the statistics storage engine of the system we were developing. The amount of data and patterns of usage of data had changed significantly from the time of engine's first implementation. Providing a lot of statistics in different perspective was one of the main features of the system so there were no surprise the system became slower and slower. Unfortunately, the engine should be rewritten almost from scratch and Product Owner constantly disposed team's suggestions to rebuild it. <em>"It's expensive,"</em> explained he. For more than 4 months the team had been putting newer traffic signs (made multiple speed-up tweaks) until one major client couldn't retrieve critical data for a large period of time and raised a burning issue. When the engine was finally ready, users' satisfaction vastly improved because page loading time decreased by 3x on average and by 10x in some special cases.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter you work with a railway crossing or a statistics engine, you should always remember <strong>what goals are behind them and if you achieve them by cheap embellishment</strong>.</p>
