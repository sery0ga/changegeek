When I start doing a new product, the first question I answer is "Why do <em>I</em> need it?" This question is so important to me, because it determines <strong>the criteria of my happiness</strong> during a long period of the product's life.

<blockquote><p>Great products are created by happy people. I must be happy in the first place to make one.</p></blockquote>
<p>There's rarely just one reason why you start doing something. I found three major reasons "Why Kudobox?":</p>
<ol>
<li>I do want to create a product which makes a positive impact on people's lives</li>
<li>I want to develop a product because I love developing products</li>
<li>I want to have a product which brings me money and let me live wherever I wish</li>
</ol>
<p><strong></strong><em>Both </em>the<em> </em>reasons <em>and</em> their order are important to me.</p>
<p>I was on an startup ideation workshop several days ago and one speaker was talking about his success. He began his speech with a phrase <em>"I'm going to tell you how to make products which will bring you a huge pile of money"</em>.  His talk was all about money. At the end he was asked what if his product harms people and he replied <em>"Well, yeah, it's possible but I'll care about it when I become a billionaire"</em>. His approach is alien to me though I understand his position.</p>
<p>If you put money first, you <strong>must</strong> get them fast. Otherwise you won't be happy. Unfortunately, it's only possible if you make <em>painkillers.</em></p>
<blockquote><p><a title="Kudobox" href="http://kudobox.co" target="_blank">Kudobox</a> doesn't help people to kill their pain. It helps them to start living a healthier and happier life.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this path — the path of changing habits — is really long. You need something to be constantly motivated by. For me it's <strong>people's emotions</strong> when they receive kudos.</p>
<p>Just look!</p>
