Several days ago Jurgen wrote a very nice post about purpose and commitment, <a href="http://noop.nl/2015/04/no.html" target="_blank">No</a>. If you haven't seen it yet, <a href="http://noop.nl/2015/04/no.html" target="_blank">check the article</a> right now. It's important for understanding the text below. I wait while you're reading.

Ready?

Jurgen says,

> When you know your destination, you can say “No” to the detours.

It's a good observation. However it has one limitation. **What if you don't know your destination? What if you cannot paint a mental picture of your week in five or ten years?**

I know some people who are not able to do it. *I* wasn't able to paint the picture just a couple of years ago.

I didn't know when to say "No" and when to say "Yes". I was unsure and felt insecure. I felt like a looser every time I made a decision and said "No" to find out later that a project became a big success. The feeling didn't last for too long as I'm too optimistic by nature. Yet I didn't try to change the situation.

After joining <a href="http://happymelly.com" target="_blank">Happy Melly</a> I realized that the time for change had come. **I started to say "Yes" to every new opportunity or idea**. I became a freelancer, I worked as a consultant, I launched a new product unsuccessfully, I renovated my flat, I danced at the end of my talk at ALE, I went on a [world tour](/tour) and more.

Today I'm still shaping my vision for the future. My destination is not clear but it's less blurred than a year ago. I learned to say "No" and I'm doing it quite often now. Jurgen is right. You should say "No".

> Before you should be brave to say "Yes".

There's a chance that you will wake up one morning, go to the bathroom, start brushing your teeth, yellow bulb will appear above your head and you'll shout, *"Eurika! I clearly see what I want to do next ten years."* It may happen. *I* decided to increase the chances. I try, I fail and I try again.

**What is your choice?**
