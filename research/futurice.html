      <div class="content">
        <h4>Tribes</h4>
        <p><b>Tribe</b> is a group of maximum 60 Futulainens united by the only principle - they want to work together.
  The tribes are customer-oriented. All services provided by Futurice to its customers are provided by members of
  the tribes. Each tribe is responsible for its P&amp;L, employee engagement and professional improvement,
  customer satisfaction and so on. In short, each tribe operates as a small company and as autonomously as possible from other tribes.</p>

      <p>Being part of a tribe doesn't mean Futulainen doesn't work on projects with people
  from other tribes. Futurice lives by its values: <a href="#values">care about customer</a>_
  goes first and removes any destructive competition.</p>

      <p>Each tribe has 3-4 leaders that were suggested and elected by members of the tribe.
  The leaders are responsible for helping members of the tribe to do a great job and
  keep the tribe successful and engaged. The leaders practice <i>lead and engage</i>
  approach, not <i>command and control</i>. Their power is limited and Futulainens could
  vote by their feet - if they don't like the tribe they could leave it any day.</p>

      <p>Futulainens have traditionally-named position titles like "Design Lead" or
  "Software Developer". I think the reason is that they work with many clients
  with more traditional cultures and strict hierarchies and clearly defined titles
  simplify collaboration.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="reference-block">
        <blockquote>
            Tribe has 3-4 chiefs and the rest are tribe members. The tribe
size is capped at 60 (with desired minimum being 30, but this may not
be strictly adhered to). There is no externally expected structure
within the tribe; any internal structure a tribe has is of their own
devising.

      <div class="content">
        <p>Futurice believes that people won't be able to make good decision themselves without open and truthful
  communications. All information is available to everyone in the company and they constantly improve its quality:
  not only people should know but they also should easily and clearly understand what the information conveys.</p>

        <ul class="dash">
          <li>All meetings are open. Everyone can join, listen and give an opinion</li>
          <li>Notes from weekly executives' meetings are shared with the whole staff</li>
          <li>Every month a report on financial performance is shared. It contains a lot of visual data to be easy to grasp.</li>
          <li>News about new hires, changes, projects and their statuses are delivered through Basecamp, Yammer, emails and face to face meetings.</li>
          <li>For internal conferences and events a video conference connection is set up. Presentation are recorded and available
          on the intranet.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><i>FutuFriday</i> is held every first Friday of a month and it's common for all locations. FutuFriday takes a whole day
    and is devoted to learning, sharing and creating a spirit of Futurice. It consists of several sections including
    PayDay Pizza, Speed Date with CEO, Pecha Kucha and others. At that day all Futulainens come to offices from clients'
    locations to share news, talk to colleagues and have fun.</p>

        <p>Walls in the offices are actively used to share news, emotions, values. There are:</p>

        <ul class="dash">
          <li><b>Strategy wall</b> - an area on the kitchen wall where you can put your own ideas and wishes regarding the firm's strategy</li>
          <li><b>Proud Wall</b> - office has a wall space, where anybody can put prints and pictures of successful projects, and other
    topics of pride.</li>
          <li><b>QualityTime</b> - Quality Assurance Newsletter which is placed in toilets and gained wide popularity.</li>
          <li><b>and many others.</b></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="clear-fix">There's Micro Communication Team which is responsible for promotion and development of internal communication across
    the enterprise. Its activities include blog writing, communication trainings, FutuFriday concept development.</p>

      <h3 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict Resolution</h3>
      <div class="content">
        <p>Futurice is built in a way that conflicts can be avoided at the outset or
  their emergence could be detected in early stages before actual clashes and
  unfavourable situations take place.</p>

        <ul class="dash">
          <li>common values and daily focus on everybody's well-being remove a lot of pressure;</li>
          <li>job satisfaction is regularly monitored through monthly surveys;</li>

  openly.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Thanks to <a href="#decision-making">3x2 model</a>, employees are obliged to do their best to
    find solution. Strong focus on autonomy and self-management significantly increase
    the chance Futulainen resolves an issue himself.</p>

        <p>However, sometimes conflicts couldn't be resolved one on one. For this purpose
    a number of safety and support networks exists. Futulainen can contact:</p>

        <ul class="clear-fix dash">
          <li>mentor, supervisor or coach;</li>
          <li>HR team which constantly communicate with employees to ensure it's very easy

        <p>Futurice has pretty formalized process with a sharp focus on fit by values. If

        <p>Another important difference is that Futurice doesn't hire by needs. They have

  urgency. However, they won't hire anyone just to close a role.</p>

        <p id="interview">Futurice's recruitment steps:</p>

        <ol>
          <li><b>Get to know</b>. Run by HR and aimed to set up initial relationships with

          <li><b>Competence evaluation</b>. Run by HR and aimed to understand a level of qualification
  of a candidate. At this step the candidate decides which available team she wants
  to join;</li>
          <li><b>Team interview</b>. Run by team members (at least 3). A candidate gets homework
  which is discussed at the interview;</li>
          <li><b>Career level and career plan</b>. Run by supervisor and mentor and aimed
  to create an initial realistic career plan;</li>
          <li><b>Final</b>. Run by HR, aimed to close the recruitment process and at which

        <h4>Onboarding</h4>
        <p>Futurice does it best to make a new employee a [...] member of the company. After
  4 months of onboarding process a new employee should have a clear picture of the
  company, know a lot of people, have a developed career plan and etc.</p>

        <p>It all starts on the first day when a new employee meets her team, mentor, supervisor,
  career coach, CEO and other random people.</p>

        <p>Onboarding includes many training like financial education, information security,
  intellectual property, quality. On first two months the employee also takes part
  in several group sessions aimed to provide basic information about different
  activities of the company, introduce new employees to each other and familiarize
  with various professional disciplines.</p>

        <p>During the onboarding process the employee has several interviews with HR, supervisor

      <div class="content">
        <p>Futurice has, probably, the most impressive and well-developed program
      for personal growth. However it shouldn't surprise you as it's completely in
      line with one of their <a href="#values">values</a>. Futurice created a system
      which motivates and helps you to learn and discover new things daily, stay
      aware of your progress and get support from your colleagues.</p>

        <p>Futurice Career Carrier (FCC) program consists of four main elements:</p>

        <ul class="short">
          <li>Career Path model,</li>
          <li>Mentoring/Career Coaching,</li>
          <li>MAD,</li>
          <li>Weekly :).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Career Path</h4>
        <p>Карьерная Дорожка &mdash; это план долговременного профессионального
        развития, разрабатываемый каждый сотрудником самостоятельно при поддержке
        ментора, представителя HR и менеджера. Работа над ней начинается еще на
        этапе <a href="#interview">собеседования</a>, а изменения
        в нее вносятся на регулярной основе. </p>

        <p>Карьерная дорожка помогает понять, в каком направлении сотрудник хочет развиваться и более четко определить возможности, которые ему
        может предложить компания.</p>

        <h4>Mentoring</h4>
        <p>To proceed faster in personal growth, every Futulainen may have a mentor.
      Mentor plays multiple roles: the traditional mentor, coach, teacher, sparring
      partner (career and professional development) or work partner, as well as
      hugger, or a listener.</p>

        <p>Mentors are not simply more experienced colleagues &mdash;
      they are trained on Mentor Camps to give you as much support as possible.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>In addition to a developed career path, Futulainens have weekly, monthly
      and semi-annually checkpoints. On semi-annually checkpoints a Futulainen
      together with the mentor and the supervisor creates a long-term vision and
      objectives. The mentor and the supervisor help to align the objectives with
      company's and team's strategy and vision, career patterns and so on. If needed
      they add short-term milestones to the list. Both long- and short-term vision
      and objectives are public thus enabling future support from other employees.</p>

        <h4>MAD</h4>
        <p>Monthly checkpoints are called <b>MAD (Monthly Anonymous Developer)</b>
      and held on <a href="#information-flow">FutuFridays</a>. It's an one-hour
      meeting when each employee goes through the targets in a group of colleagues
      he considered best: team, project team or competence area team. Futulainens
      answer four questions:</p>

        <ul class="dash">
          <li>What are the goals?</li>
          <li>What did I try to make last month?</li>

        <h4>Weekly :)</h4>
        <p>Еженедельные встречи получили свое название не случайно: раз в
        неделю члены племени, зачастую проводящие в офисах клиентов почти все дни, собираются и делятся своими эмоциями, достижениями, неудачами и
        сложностями.</p>
        <p>Встречи позволяют членам племени сохранить чувство "плеча", получить
        или предоставить необходимую помощь, рассказать о проблемных клиентах
        и узнать последние новости.</p>

        <br/>
        <p>Employees in Futurice run multiple internal conferences, trainings and
      workshops where everyone can learn or take part. <a href="#decision-making">3x2 model</a>
      motivates people to be proactive and organize trainings on topics not related
      to job at all. As mentioned in <a href="#investments--budgets">Investments</a>
      block, Futulainens can use their credit card for taking part in conferences or courses.</p>

        <p>Futurice has a dedicated team responsible for FCC and personal growth -
      HR Greenhouse micro team. They help to organize trainings, improve learning
      facilities, set up functional communication channels and more.</p>
