Two days ago I run a distributed meetup where three teams from different locations (one in Russia, two in Moldova) and several online participants took part. We had three sessions with hot discussions after them.

<p>That was the first time we used such format. Of course there were some technical issues and other not smoothly going stuff but reviews were very bright and people actually liked the meetup.</p>
<p>As an organizer I made notes during the event and I want to share them with you. To clarify the text below, we used Google Hangout and many notes are directly related to it.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical stuff</strong></h2>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Use two accounts to connect to a Hangout in one location. Film an auditory and a speaker using the first one. Share a presentation and record a speaker's voice from the second one. In such scheme people at remote locations can see a speaker when a presentation is shared and it gives them a feeling of physical contact.</li>
<li>Use portable USB microphones. Hangout catches a background noise very well and you need to mute yourself constantly when people from other locations start speaking otherwise a disgusting echo appears. Sitting near a notebook and clicking <strong>Mute/Unmute</strong> causes unexpected pauses and decreases a meeting's energy.</li>
<li>Share a separate window only. If you have your presentation online, open it in another browser window, separate from the one with a Hangout.</li>
<li>If a speaker shares his screen and you see a black rectangle, suggest her to reconnect.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Presentations</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li>Google Hangout doesn't allow to watch video in fullscreen. Your presentation will be smaller than you expect. Use bigger fonts and less text.</li>
<li>One thought - one slide. When speakers give a talk onsite they can show something to an auditory on a slide using their hands and saying "According to this picture". It's not an option for a distributed talk. People won't see what you try to explain unless organizers use very good cameras and film both you and your presentation.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2><strong>Organizational stuff</strong></h2>
<div>
<ol>
<li>There should be a person who monitors a Hangout's chat. Sometimes a sound or a video disappears and it's the only source of feedback from remote locations.</li>
<li>Reserve longer time slots between sessions. After all, it's a meetup. Give people an opportunity to interact with each other :). It's also a good idea to have an after-party.</li>
<li>Always start live broadcasting on time (if you have one). Online participants in front of their screens don't have a person to chat waiting for action to begin.</li>
<li>Give you enough time for preparation and gear testing. Have a test run a day before if possible.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Google Hangout is a great cheap way to scale meetups. Our participants mentioned two things particularly:</p>
<div>
<ul class="dash">
<li>an opportunity to listen to excellent speakers from remote locations;</li>
<li>a chamber atmosphere because a number of participants on site wasn't not large.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think distributed meetups can become good alternatives to conferences as you can listen and talk to speakers without paying flight and hotel expenses.</p>
