My fiancee Maria and her former colleague Natalia co-organized a meeting of top managers of state companies last Friday. After the event was over they found themselves in a cafe with one of the top managers at a table nearby. They started discussing the event and the manager said, "Well, I wasn't impressed by the organization. It was better last year." But after a while he admitted that not the organization of the event was poor but the lack of unity and energy they had had during the previous meeting. And then he said to them, "I'm sorry I was wrong".

<p>Dave Kerpen, the CEO of <a href="http://www.likeablelocal.com/" target="_blank">Likeable Local</a>, <a href="http://www.inc.com/dave-kerpen/how-to-get-everything-you-want.html">writes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone knows that. It's not when you make a mistake that's a problem; it's when you make a mistake and are too proud or embarrassed to be vulnerable, fess up, and apologize. Just say "I'm sorry" and let another person forgive you, so you can move on...</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes it's painfully difficult to admit you are wrong. But nevertheless it's an essential part of a good management.</p>
<p>So <strong>dare to say "I'm sorry"</strong>.</p>
