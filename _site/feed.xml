          <description>&lt;p&gt;Working at organisations which grow very fast reminds me of bull riding. When several hundred people join a company’s campus during a year you should expect to change offices, switch projects and bump to a new person in your team every two weeks or so. These factors might decrease employees engagement. In addition, during fast growth management style tends to be more &lt;i&gt;command and control&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;lead and adapt&lt;/i&gt;. It’s reasonable as many new people are not aligned with an organisation yet and couldn’t change direction fast enough all through self-organisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Netlight</title>
        
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading a number of invitations I learned to predict if I would truly enjoy the time taking an interview and finding out interesting facts about an organisation. Probably the most important factor is a mood of a letter. You feel it with your fibres when an author sincerely loves the company, is proud of it and very excited to let everyone know more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://se.linkedin.com/in/karinhartzell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; works at Netlight and her letter had all of those.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Several days ago Jurgen wrote a very nice post about purpose and commitment, &lt;a href=&quot;http://noop.nl/2015/04/no.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;No&lt;/a&gt;. If you haven’t seen it yet, &lt;a href=&quot;http://noop.nl/2015/04/no.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;check the article&lt;/a&gt; right now. It’s important for understanding the text below. I wait while you’re reading.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I promised myself to write this post yesterday. I actually started it. And then I opened Crisp’s blog and got sucked into it. It’s that good. I haven’t visited it for a while and spent at least an hour enjoying the articles. I recommend you to do the same. Right after you finish this post :)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of my tour is to meet people from &lt;a href=&quot;http://happymelly.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Happy Melly&lt;/a&gt; network. I was more than lucky in Helsinki to spend a day with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/skotlov/posts/10202842788510087&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marja and Hannu&lt;/a&gt;, and to have a couple of beers with &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/04/08/flowa.html&quot;&gt;Antti&lt;/a&gt;. What a good time it was! I couldn’t wait it would repeat some day in some way. Thankfully Happy Melly has its “agents” everywhere. Last Monday I finally met with Johan whom I haven’t seen for ages and Pia-Maria whom I’ve never seen in person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Vincity</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;My arrival to Tampere wasn’t welcoming. It was snowing, windy and quite cold. I realized that I made a mistake leaving my gloves at home. Morning city didn’t make a slightest attempt to improve the situation. WiFi in the cafe I chose because of the sign “Free WiFi” was broken. Three random commuters I asked about the nearest coffee shop couldn’t help me. Nevertheless I didn’t allow those small troubles to spoil my mood and I was right. Several hours in Vincit are worth much more “suffering” than I got.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://futurice.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Futurice&lt;/a&gt; and me have the longest “relationships” among the organisations in my tour. It sparkled my interest in more detailed investigation of fantastic companies. Futurice also became the first organisation which I studied carefully and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/research/futurice.html&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt;. As you see it was no surprise at all I was excited when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ykarikos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yrjö&lt;/a&gt; invited me to take part in &lt;em&gt;FutuFriday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reaktor.fi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reaktor&lt;/a&gt; got into my sight when I was preparing for two weeks in Helsinki. I went through my notes and found the only brief &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/finnish-reaktor-innovations-was-selected-as-the-best-workplace-in-europe-152597585.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the company. It described that Reaktor won Best Place to Work in Europe award two times. Nevertheless, I got hooked. My interest grew considerably after I had visited their website and watched the video below. Reaktor’s own band recorded it and they use it “to make recruiting the summer help a whole lot more fun”.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anttiki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evilbubu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juha&lt;/a&gt; last summer on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ale2014.alenetwork.eu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALE&lt;/a&gt;. We should meet in Vantaa airport right before our flight. I had already spent several hours in the airport to that moment and fell asleep on a bench near the gate. Luckily I woke just in time to run into the airplane but I missed the meeting. It was the first (and I hope the last) time I missed the opportunity to drink beer with guys from Flowa.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the week was frantic. I was running like a squirrel in a wheel trying to complete a mountain of tiny mechanical tasks related to my departure. Anxiety didn’t leave me. I was fearing the tour would be a disaster. Even the meeting with friends didn’t help a lot. Yesterday I went to visit my family who just came back from Croatia where they had stayed for a week. They handed me a book and the moment I took it my mood changed considerably… &lt;/p&gt;
