          <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of my tour is to meet people from &lt;a href=&quot;http://happymelly.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Happy Melly&lt;/a&gt; network. I was more than lucky in Helsinki to spend a day with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/skotlov/posts/10202842788510087&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Marja and Hannu&lt;/a&gt;, and to have a couple of beers with &lt;a href=&quot;2015-04-08-flowa.markdown&quot;&gt;Antti&lt;/a&gt;. What a good time it was! I couldn’t wait it would repeat some day in some way. Thankfully Happy Melly has its “agents” everywhere. Last Monday I finally met with Johan whom I haven’t seen for ages and Pia-Maria whom I’ve never seen in person.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Vincity</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;My arrival to Tampere wasn’t welcoming. It was snowing, windy and quite cold. I realized that I made a mistake leaving my gloves at home. Morning city didn’t make a slightest attempt to improve the situation. WiFi in the cafe I chose because of the sign “Free WiFi” was broken. Three random commuters I asked about the nearest coffee shop couldn’t help me. Nevertheless I didn’t allow those small troubles to spoil my mood and I was right. Several hours in Vincit are worth much more “suffering” than I got.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://futurice.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Futurice&lt;/a&gt; and me have the longest “relationships” among the organisations in my tour. It sparkled my interest in more detailed investigation of fantastic companies. Futurice also became the first organisation which I studied carefully and wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/research/futurice.html&quot;&gt;case study&lt;/a&gt;. As you see it was no surprise at all I was excited when &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ykarikos&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yrjö&lt;/a&gt; invited me to take part in &lt;em&gt;FutuFriday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reaktor.fi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Reaktor&lt;/a&gt; got into my sight when I was preparing for two weeks in Helsinki. I went through my notes and found the only brief &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/finnish-reaktor-innovations-was-selected-as-the-best-workplace-in-europe-152597585.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the company. It described that Reaktor won Best Place to Work in Europe award two times. Nevertheless, I got hooked. My interest grew considerably after I had visited their website and watched the video below. Reaktor’s own band recorded it and they use it “to make recruiting the summer help a whole lot more fun”.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I met &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anttiki&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Antti&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/evilbubu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Juha&lt;/a&gt; last summer on my way to &lt;a href=&quot;http://ale2014.alenetwork.eu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ALE&lt;/a&gt;. We should meet in Vantaa airport right before our flight. I had already spent several hours in the airport to that moment and fell asleep on a bench near the gate. Luckily I woke just in time to run into the airplane but I missed the meeting. It was the first (and I hope the last) time I missed the opportunity to drink beer with guys from Flowa.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;The beginning of the week was frantic. I was running like a squirrel in a wheel trying to complete a mountain of tiny mechanical tasks related to my departure. Anxiety didn’t leave me. I was fearing the tour would be a disaster. Even the meeting with friends didn’t help a lot. Yesterday I went to visit my family who just came back from Croatia where they had stayed for a week. They handed me a book and the moment I took it my mood changed considerably… &lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you watched &lt;em&gt;&lt;a title=&quot;One fine day&quot; href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117247/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;One fine day&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;? It’s a kind funny story about two single parents who were late to bring their children to a boat trip and had to spend a whole crazy business day together. Of course falling in love at the end. I like this simple movie because it conveys very important thought: &lt;strong&gt;We should stop constantly trying to fix things. We should let them be as they are and enjoy the moment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;We use &lt;strong&gt;test runs&lt;/strong&gt; in all spheres of our life. Extreme sport athletes ride a track several times before an event to know it better. Social networks first open new features to a small set of users to check their reaction. Companies have trial periods to prove a new hire is a good fit for the rest of a team.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Hard and funny</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;No matter how many dreams there are it’s easy to have them. Living even a tiny one is hard. Looking back over my shoulder I see how often I preferred an easy choice over a hard one. It didn’t make me happy. It didn’t make my life more fun, interesting and intriguing. Only simpler. About a week ago I gladly realized this time was over and I need to thank Happy Melly for that. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>What is the colour of your life?</title>

          <description>&lt;p&gt;I experimented with multiple approaches to analyse my work. Only one of them stuck to me and have been helping me every day since then. Its major advantage is simplicity: I need to spend &lt;strong&gt;only 15 seconds per day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
