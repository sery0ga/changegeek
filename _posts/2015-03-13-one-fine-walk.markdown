Have you watched <em><a title="One fine day" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117247/" target="_blank">One fine day</a></em>? It's a kind funny story about two single parents who were late to bring their children to a boat trip and had to spend a whole crazy business day together. Of course falling in love at the end. I like this simple movie because it conveys very important thought: <strong>We should stop constantly trying to fix things. We should let them be as they are and enjoy the moment</strong>.

<p>Yesterday Google Drive app deleted almost all <a title="Happy Melly" href="http://happymelly.com" target="_blank">Happy Melly</a> and <a title="Management 3.0" href="http://management30.com" target="_blank">Management 3.0</a> shared documents. I spent two hours trying to figure out how to restore them. To my surprise it's not easy at all. Finally I sent a request to the email support. Luckily we had a copy of all documents so it wasn't major business problem. Nevertheless I was frustrated.</p>
<p>My frustration went higher when we found out <a title="Happy Melly" href="http://happymelly.com" target="_blank">Happy Melly</a> website was down. Without any good reason. In addition I got that news while enjoying my lunch. Damn notifications!</p>
<p>Again it wasn't such big deal. It lasted an hour. We do not serve thousands of customers yet and the website is not our main point of sale. It was nothing compared to a downtime I experienced few years ago. That downtime lasted 14 hours. We served millions requests per day and the damage was tangible. Anyway I was really frustrated and messaged to Slack:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>It should be a great working day today :(. It's +6 and sunny - real spring here in Saint Petersburg ...</em></p>
<p>In the middle of the day I left for a walk. I grabbed a coffee at my local coffeehouse but couldn't enjoy it. I kept thinking <em>"Why the hell am I so frustrated? There's no real damage besides several hours of wasted time"</em> and then I realized. It was not technical issues that worsened my mood but <strong>failed expectations I had for that day</strong>. MY expectations. It was ME who was spoiling MY day.</p>
<p>Not being a masochist <strong>I let my expectations go. I let the things be as they were. I let myself appreciate the moment.</strong> As soon as I did that hundreds of emotions befell on me. I heard  twittering of birds. I felt warmth of the sun on my skin. I saw crystal blueness of the sky. I savoured each sip of my wonderful cappuccino. Getting back home I found Jurgen's tweet:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Google Drive erased an entire folder tree and now our website is down. One of those days... But the sun is shining. I'll go for a walk. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zen?src=hash">#Zen</a></p>

<p>What a coincidence!</p>
<p>I've been <a href="http://franticworld.com/free-meditations-from-mindfulness/" target="_blank">practicing mindfulness</a> for more than a month now and only yesterday I actually touched it. Ironically I have to thank buggy Goggle software and unreliable web hosting provider for it.</p>

<p>It's sunny in St Petersburg today. I leave you here and go for another cup of coffee.</p>
