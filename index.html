      <p>I've been a big fan and active promoter of organizations which care about happiness and engagement of their employees for two years. I learnt a lot by reading books and articles, watching interviews and talks. Now I want to visit awesome companies, talk to people who work there, see how they produce great products.</p>
      <p>I’m going on a world tour to learn what fantastic, transparent and innovative companies are doing, share my experience and blog about my findings.</p>
