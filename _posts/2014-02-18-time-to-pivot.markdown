When I started this blog in September I was going to share my thoughts about teams, organizations and how they evolve over time. I wanted to share my experience. It happened I was lost that time. I was jiggling with multiple options and couldn't choose what I <strong>truly </strong>wanted.

<p>Looking back, I realize many of my posts were not sincere. I wasn't <strong>insanely passioned</strong> about the subject.</p>
<p>Now I have one. And it's not sex, drugs or rock-n-roll.</p>
<p><a href="http://kudobox.co"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" alt="Kudobox" src="/images/kudobox.png" width="780" height="516" /></a></p>
<p>We launched a new product <a title="Kudobox" href="http://kudobox.co" target="_blank">Kudobox </a> a couple of weeks ago. It's an extremely intuitive and fast-to-use service for sharing your appreciations with others.</p>
<p>Being small and simple, it brings me an ocean of positive emotions. You know why?</p>
<blockquote><p>It constantly brings positive emotions to others.<em> </em></p></blockquote>
<p><a title="Kudobox" href="http://kudobox.co" target="_blank">Kudobox</a> is also a challenge. We're a bunch of very motivated developers who worked together before. We have a great experience in product development and have a lot of <em>theoretical knowledge</em> how startups should be run.</p>
<blockquote><p>Can we convert our past experience and deep <em>theoretical </em>knowledge to a product which brings <em>both</em> happiness and money?</p></blockquote>
<p>I do not know :). But it's something I want to share with you.</p>
<h4><em>From this time forth I will share stories how and why we do different things in <a title="Kudobox" href="http://kudobox.co" target="_blank">Kudobox</a> and what we learn from it.</em></h4>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
