        <title>Open Salary</title>
        
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Several days ago Buffer &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.buffer.com/transparent-salaries/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; its freshly improved salary formula they had been working on for last two-three months. The article is worth reading not for the formula itself but the reasonings behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Helium and Sofa</title>
        
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;Several days ago I visited &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/04/17/welcome-to-vincity.html&quot;&gt;Vincit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2015/04/16/futufriday.html&quot;&gt;Futurice&lt;/a&gt; to collect stories for &lt;a href=&quot;http://yay4monday.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Yay4Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Though I had very clear picture in mind what kinds of stories I needed I didn’t know how to get them. No. Idea. At all. I have some experience interviewing people but it was no help that time. I gave up coming with a solution and I decided to figure it out on my very long drive to Tampere where Vincit’s head office is located.

          <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/interview.png&quot; /&gt;
I’m working on &lt;a href=&quot;http://yay4monday.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my own product&lt;/a&gt; these days. I compensate a lack of knowledge in some areas by talking to people and reading books. My current book is &lt;a href=&quot;http://leanbrandbook.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lean Brand&lt;/a&gt; which I like very much. The chapter I read yesterday talks about the audience of any product. The authors say that entrepreneurs try to target everyone too often. Instead, they should start by defining a small group of clients they want to work with. And create relationships with just one person from that group. Then, with the second one and the third one. Step by step. By identifying a unique portrait of their first customers’ entrepreneurs could create a much better message and win the attention they crave. The idea is so logical and simple that there’s no surprise many founders — including yours truly — missed it or ignored it.&lt;/p&gt;

There are a lot of lessons to learn when becoming a good entrepreneur. &lt;a href=&quot;http://kudobox.co&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kudobox&lt;/a&gt; helped taught me a great deal, and I’ve found that the most important lesson in being an entrepreneur is this:&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>First, you should believe</title>
        
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;After 2.5 years with &lt;a href=&quot;http://happymelly.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Happy Melly&lt;/a&gt; and tens of pitches, I can describe Happy Melly and its advantages in a snap. People quickly understand the general concept, but the devil lies in the details. The mechanics of collaboration in the network makes them uneasy, as it’s very different than what they’re used to. To operate effectively in a networked structure, many of us have to make an internal switch to a new system of coordinates. It’s not easy!&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;There is no secret people matter most of all in business. Leading companies realised it many years ago and compete over best talent not best technologies. They give amazing perks and create campuses employees want to live in. They make &lt;a href=&quot;https://pando.com/2014/03/22/revealed-apple-and-googles-wage-fixing-cartel-involved-dozens-more-companies-over-one-million-employees/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;illegal agreements&lt;/a&gt; with competitors. They &lt;a href=&quot;http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/facebook-acquires-friendfeed/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;acquire smaller companies&lt;/a&gt; to get people working in them. Google, a leader in the war for talent, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/google-paid-two-employees-tens-of-millions-dollars-not-to-take-jobs-at-twitter-2011-4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;famously pays&lt;/a&gt; ridiculous amount of money to its employees to stay.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Each company I visit has its unique atmosphere and dynamics. One reminds of a meetup where people learn new things, share experience and drink beer. Other reminds of a hackaton where participants press forward to create and deploy a working product as fast as possible. &lt;a href=&quot;http://ministry.de&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ministry&lt;/a&gt; is a family gathering where you are always welcomed, find support and be challenged at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Last ten weeks I enjoyed coffee in nine cities, visited sixteen companies, met five members of &lt;a href=&quot;http://happymelly.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Happy Melly&lt;/a&gt; team and had both very productive and very unproductive days.  I learned accordingly and created a list of rules which might help you to travel around Europe and work at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;

          <description>&lt;p&gt;Working at organisations which grow very fast reminds me of bull riding. When several hundred people join a company’s campus during a year you should expect to change offices, switch projects and bump to a new person in your team every two weeks or so. These factors might decrease employees engagement. In addition, during fast growth management style tends to be more &lt;i&gt;command and control&lt;/i&gt; than &lt;i&gt;lead and adapt&lt;/i&gt;. It’s reasonable as many new people are not aligned with an organisation yet and couldn’t change direction fast enough all through self-organisation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

        <title>Netlight</title>
        
        
        
          <description>&lt;p&gt;After reading a number of invitations I learned to predict if I would truly enjoy the time taking an interview and finding out interesting facts about an organisation. Probably the most important factor is a mood of a letter. You feel it with your fibres when an author sincerely loves the company, is proud of it and very excited to let everyone know more. &lt;a href=&quot;https://se.linkedin.com/in/karinhartzell&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Karin&lt;/a&gt; works at Netlight and her letter had all of those.&lt;/p&gt;
