<em>I'm looking for a job in Europe now and this post describes some experience I got during this process.</em>

<p>I had an interview a couple of weeks ago for a Scrum Master role in a very nice company in Berlin. Not only they make amazing products but their website and information about them on the internet prove they are a bunch of talented energized creators. I thought it would be great to join them. Unfortunately they had a different opinion to mine what a good match for them should look like and I got a refusal. At the same time they provided a detailed feedback on the interview and it was one point in it which made me think.</p>

The point was

<em>according to your resume and the interview, there's no decisiveness in what you want to do - being Scrum Master, agile PM or Product Owner.</em>

<p>I wasn't surprised at all. My first thought was</p>

<em>
    well, they are right. I'm not sure what role I would prefer. I can even say I don't care which one of these roles to play if it's within an agile self-organized and highly motivated team. It seems to be wrong. How can I change that?
</em>

More I thought about it, more I became certain that it was not <strong><em>how can I change it?</em></strong> but <em><strong>why should I change it?</strong></em> I am very decisive about <strong>WHAT</strong> I want to do

<blockquote>I want to help people being happier at their work</blockquote>

<p>It's true that I'm not particular decisive about <strong>HOW</strong> I want to do it. I have several options I like (for example, Scrum Master role) and I prefer to <a title="Real Options: Never commit early unless you know why" href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/real-options-enhance-agility">keep them open</a>.</p>
<p>The lesson's learnt: from now on I'm emphasizing a <strong>what</strong> part more than a <strong>how</strong> part. Higher purpose lets me to move a previous <strong>what </strong>category to <strong>how</strong> category.</p>

_How often do you take such kind of indecision into account when interviewing a candidate? Is it good or bad?_
